        <p class="text">Thank you for taking the time to visit my site! I was born in Philadelphia, PA and bred in South Jersey. I have a passion for visual art. So much so, that I studied Graphic Design at Rowan University in Glassboro, NJ. I always had an affinity for technology; specifically, mobile technology. I was infactuated with the sleek and friendly Palm Pre device that my older cousin owned way back when. A bit later, the original iPhone was revealed during a commercial break between the Academy Awards. From that very moment, my imagination piqued. I had to be apart of that world. How could anyone make something like this? I delved head first into learning about tech. Years later, here I am  studying to become a software engineer. I'm grateful for my wonderful family and amazing fiance, Kate, who helped me get to this very moment!</p>
